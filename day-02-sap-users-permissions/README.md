# Day 02 – SAP Users, Groups & Permissions (Linux)

## Objective
Simulate real SAP BASIS Linux administration tasks involving user management,
group assignment, and directory ownership.

## Tasks Performed
- Created SAP system group (`sapsys`)
- Created SAP admin user (`sapadm`)
- Simulated SAP directory structure
- Assigned ownership using `chown`
- Verified permissions using `ls -l`

## Why This Matters in SAP
SAP application processes must run under controlled users and groups
to ensure system security, stability, and compliance.
